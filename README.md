EE272_DesignHW2
In this project we designed a Network On Chip (NOC) that communicates using only 9-bits to a device and sends and receives 6 types of messages(commands).
To send back the data over the NOC to the testbench, a fifo was required to store the simultaneous messages being generated in the device/NOC.
